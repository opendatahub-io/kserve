                            Namespace is the namespace of the referenced object. When unspecified, the local
                            namespace is inferred.

                            Note that when a namespace different than the local namespace is specified,
                            a ReferenceGrant object is required in the referent namespace to allow that
                            namespace's owner to accept the reference. See the ReferenceGrant
                            documentation for details: https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/referencegrant/
